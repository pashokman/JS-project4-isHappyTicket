A happy ticket is a ticket with such a serial number that the sum of the first three digits is the same as the sume of the last three digits.

For example, ticket number 385916 is a happy ticket, since 3 + 8 + 5 = 9 + 1 + 6

Implement and export as default a function that verifies the happiness of a ticket. This function should return true if the ticket is happy, and false otherwise.

isHappyTicket(385916); // true
isHappyTicket(231002); // false
isHappyTicket(128722); // true
